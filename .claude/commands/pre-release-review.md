description: Run all review agents (docs, changelog, tests) against current branch changes
---

Run all three review agents to validate the current branch changes:

1. Use the **docs-reviewer** agent to check documentation completeness
2. Use the **changelog-reviewer** agent to verify CHANGELOG.md is up to date
3. Use the **test-reviewer** agent to ensure test coverage is adequate

Run all three agents and provide a consolidated summary of findings.
