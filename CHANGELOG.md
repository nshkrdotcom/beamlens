## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Autonomous watcher system — LLM-driven loops that monitor domains and fire alerts
- Built-in BEAM domain for VM metrics (memory, processes, schedulers, atoms, ports)
- Built-in ETS domain for table monitoring (counts, memory, top tables)
- Built-in GC domain for garbage collection statistics
- Built-in Ports domain for port/socket monitoring
- Built-in Sup domain for supervisor tree monitoring
- `Beamlens.Domain` behaviour for implementing custom monitoring domains
- `callback_docs/0` callback in Domain behaviour for dynamic LLM documentation
- `Beamlens.list_watchers/0` — list all running watchers with status
- `Beamlens.watcher_status/1` — get details about a specific watcher
- `:client_registry` option to configure custom LLM providers (OpenAI, Ollama, AWS Bedrock, Google Gemini, etc.)
- LLM provider configuration guide with retry policies, fallback chains, and round-robin patterns
- Telemetry events for observability (watcher lifecycle, LLM calls, alerts)
- Lua sandbox for safe metric collection callbacks

### Changed

- BEAM domain callbacks now prefixed: `get_memory` → `beam_get_memory`, etc.
- Domain behaviour now requires `callback_docs/0` callback
- Upgraded Puck from 0.1.0 to 0.2.2 (adds context compaction support)
- Watchers now run as continuous LLM-driven loops instead of scheduled cron jobs

### Removed

- Circuit breaker protection (use LLM provider retry policies instead)
- Judge agent quality verification
- Scheduled cron-based watcher triggers (watchers now run continuously)
- Beamlens.investigate/1 — alerts now fire automatically via telemetry
- Beamlens.trigger_watcher/1 — watchers are self-managing
- Beamlens.pending_alerts?/0 — replaced by telemetry events
