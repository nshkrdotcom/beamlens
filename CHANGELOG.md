## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Process reduction profiling callbacks in Beam skill: `beam_top_reducers_window/2`, `beam_reduction_rate/2`, `beam_burst_detection/2`, `beam_hot_functions/2`
- ETS table growth tracking callbacks in Ets skill (`ets_growth_stats`, `ets_leak_candidates`)
- GrowthStore GenServer for periodic ETS table size sampling
- SystemMonitor skill for tracking long_gc and long_schedule events
- Scheduler utilization (wall time) tracking callbacks in Beam skill (`beam_scheduler_utilization`, `beam_scheduler_capacity_available`, `beam_scheduler_health`)
- Message queue overload detection callbacks in Beam skill
- Binary memory leak detection callbacks in Beam skill (`beam_binary_leak`, `beam_binary_top_memory`)
- Message queue overload detection: `beam_queue_processes/1`, `beam_queue_growth/2`, `beam_queue_stats/0`
- Operators and Coordinator are now always-running supervised processes
- New `Operator.run_async/3` for running analysis in the background with progress notifications
- Multiple analysis requests to the same operator are queued and processed in order
- Google AI (Gemini) provider support for integration tests

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Configuration option renamed from `:operators` to `:skills`
  ```elixir
  # Before
  {Beamlens, operators: [Beamlens.Skill.Beam]}

  # After
  {Beamlens, skills: [Beamlens.Skill.Beam]}
  ```
- **Breaking:** `Operator.run/2` raises `ArgumentError` if the operator is not configured in the supervision tree
- **Breaking:** `Coordinator.run/2` raises `ArgumentError` if Beamlens is not in the supervision tree

### Removed

- `Operator.Supervisor.start_operator/2` - configure operators via `:skills` option instead
- `Operator.Supervisor.stop_operator/2` - operators now remain running

### Fixed

- Exception skill snapshot data now serializes correctly to JSON
- Unit tests no longer make LLM provider calls
- Eval tests now respect `BEAMLENS_TEST_PROVIDER` configuration
