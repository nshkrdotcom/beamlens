## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Port queue saturation monitoring with growth tracking and prediction

- Rate limiting for auto-triggers with configurable `max_triggers_per_hour` (default: 3)
- Statistical anomaly detection Anomaly skill with self-learning baselines
- Z-score analysis for detecting metric deviations (3+ standard deviations)
- Three-phase state machine: learning → active → cooldown
- Configurable thresholds: z_threshold, consecutive_required, cooldown_ms
- Runtime configuration via supervision tree (opt-in, requires enabled: true)
- MetricStore GenServer for time-series metric data with ETS ring buffer
- BaselineStore GenServer for learned baselines with optional DETS persistence
- Detector GenServer for collection, analysis, and anomaly escalation
- Pure statistical functions: mean, std_dev, z_score, percentile, ema
- Zero production impact (all reads from skill snapshots)
- Overload skill for message queue overload analysis and adaptive response recommendations
- Overload classification: transient (burst), sustained (capacity exceeded), critical (cascade)
- Bottleneck detection identifying downstream blocking, CPU-bound, or contention issues
- Cascading failure detection across multiple subsystems
- Remediation recommendations based on overload type and bottleneck location
- Process relationship monitoring in Supervisor skill: `sup_unlinked_processes`, `sup_orphaned_processes`, `sup_tree_integrity`, `sup_zombie_children`
- Unlinked process detection for finding processes with no links or monitors (potential leaks)
- Orphaned process detection for finding processes whose parent/ancestor has died
- Supervision tree integrity checking with anomaly detection (crash loops, high undefined ratios, large supervisors)
- Zombie children detection for finding children of dead supervisors
- GC pattern analysis callbacks: `gc_find_spiky_processes`, `gc_find_lazy_gc_processes`, `gc_calculate_efficiency`, `gc_recommend_hibernation`, `gc_get_long_gcs`
- Memory variance detection for spiky process memory usage patterns
- Lazy GC process identification for memory hoarding detection
- GC efficiency ratio calculation (reclaimed vs allocated)
- Hibernation recommendations with estimated memory savings
- Long GC event history from VmEvents skill integration
- Memory allocator monitoring in Allocator skill: `allocator_summary`, `allocator_by_type`, `allocator_fragmentation`, `allocator_problematic`
- Allocator metrics: carrier utilization, block efficiency, fragmentation detection for long-running nodes
- Inet port monitoring callbacks in Ports skill: `ports_list_inet`, `ports_top_by_buffer`, `ports_inet_stats`
- Socket state tracking for TCP/UDP/SCTP ports with local/remote addresses

- Atom table growth monitoring callbacks in Beam skill: `beam_atom_growth_rate/1`, `beam_atom_leak_detected/0`
- AtomStore GenServer for periodic atom count sampling
- Busy port detection monitoring in VmEvents skill: `busy_port` and `busy_dist_port` event tracking
- Ports skill callbacks: `ports_busy_events` and `ports_busy_dist_events` for querying busy port events
- Process reduction profiling callbacks in Beam skill: `beam_top_reducers_window/2`, `beam_reduction_rate/2`, `beam_burst_detection/2`, `beam_hot_functions/2`
- ETS table growth tracking callbacks in Ets skill (`ets_growth_stats`, `ets_leak_candidates`)
- GrowthStore GenServer for periodic ETS table size sampling
- VmEvents skill for tracking long_gc and long_schedule events
- Scheduler utilization (wall time) tracking callbacks in Beam skill (`beam_scheduler_utilization`, `beam_scheduler_capacity_available`, `beam_scheduler_health`)
- Message queue overload detection callbacks in Beam skill: `beam_queue_processes/1`, `beam_queue_growth/2`, `beam_queue_stats/0`
- Binary memory leak detection callbacks in Beam skill (`beam_binary_leak`, `beam_binary_top_memory`, `beam_binary_info`)
- Binary memory tracking in Beam skill snapshot (`binary_memory_mb`)
- Rate limiting for `beam_binary_leak` GC calls (once per minute)
- `Beamlens.Supervisor.registered_skills/0` function to retrieve configured skill modules
- Message queue overload detection: `beam_queue_processes/1`, `beam_queue_growth/2`, `beam_queue_stats/0`
- Operators and Coordinator are now always-running supervised processes
- New `Operator.run_async/3` for running analysis in the background with progress notifications
- Multiple analysis requests to the same operator are queued and processed in order
- Google AI (Gemini) provider support for integration tests

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Renamed skills for clarity:
  - `Beamlens.Skill.Monitor` → `Beamlens.Skill.Anomaly`
  - `Beamlens.Skill.Sup` → `Beamlens.Skill.Supervisor`
  - `Beamlens.Skill.System` → `Beamlens.Skill.Os`
  - `Beamlens.Skill.SystemMonitor` → `Beamlens.Skill.VmEvents`
- **Breaking:** Updated atom shortcuts: `:monitor` → `:anomaly`, `:sup` → `:supervisor`, `:system` → `:os`, `:system_monitor` → `:vm_events`
- **Breaking:** Configuration option renamed from `:operators` to `:skills`
  ```elixir
  # Before
  {Beamlens, operators: [Beamlens.Skill.Beam]}

  # After
  {Beamlens, skills: [Beamlens.Skill.Beam]}
  ```
- **Breaking:** `Operator.run/2` raises `ArgumentError` if the operator is not configured in the supervision tree
- **Breaking:** `Coordinator.run/2` raises `ArgumentError` if Beamlens is not in the supervision tree

### Removed

- `Operator.Supervisor.start_operator/2` - configure operators via `:skills` option instead
- `Operator.Supervisor.stop_operator/2` - operators now remain running

### Fixed

- Exception skill snapshot data now serializes correctly to JSON
- Unit tests no longer make LLM provider calls
- Eval tests now respect `BEAMLENS_TEST_PROVIDER` configuration
