# BeamLens

An AI agent that continuously monitors your Elixir application.

## The Problem

Scheduler utilization spikes. Memory grows. A GenServer queue backs up.

You open your dashboards—Prometheus, Datadog, AppSignal. The data is there. But before you can investigate, you're correlating metrics, cross-referencing logs, building context.

BeamLens assembles that context for you—a starting point to verify, not a black box to trust.

## Start With Context, Not Just Metrics

```
Without BeamLens:
memory_total: 12582912000
memory_processes: 4194304000
memory_ets: 6815744000
process_count: 50000

With BeamLens:
"ETS memory at 54% of total system memory—well above typical levels.
Investigate ETS table growth, potentially from cache or session storage."
```

## Why BeamLens

- **BEAM-Native Tooling** — Direct access to BEAM instrumentation: schedulers, memory, processes, atoms. The context generic APM tools can't see.

- **Read-Only by Design** — Zero writes to your system. Type-safe outputs. Your data stays in your infrastructure.

- **Supplements Your Stack** — Works alongside Prometheus, Datadog, AppSignal, Sentry—whatever you're already using.

- **Bring Your Own Model** — Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, AWS Bedrock, and more via BAML's provider support.

## How It Works

BeamLens uses an **orchestrator-workers** architecture. Watchers continuously monitor specific domains (BEAM VM, databases, etc.) on cron schedules. When they detect anomalies, an AI agent investigates and correlates findings.

**Key features:**
- **LLM-based baseline learning** — Watchers learn normal behavior over time, no manual thresholds needed
- **Automatic anomaly detection** — Deviations from baseline trigger investigation
- **Telemetry integration** — All events flow through your existing observability stack

No separate services to deploy. Just an Elixir library.

## Installation

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:beamlens, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```

## Quick Start

Set your Anthropic API key:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

Add to your supervision tree:

```elixir
def start(_type, _args) do
  children = [
    {Beamlens, watchers: [{:beam, "*/5 * * * *"}]}
  ]

  Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
end
```

The `:beam` watcher monitors BEAM VM metrics (memory, processes, schedulers). It learns baseline behavior automatically and reports anomalies when detected.

## Watcher Management

Monitor and control watchers at runtime:

```elixir
# List all running watchers
Beamlens.list_watchers()
#=> [%{watcher: :beam, cron: "*/5 * * * *", run_count: 12, ...}]

# Manually trigger a watcher check
Beamlens.trigger_watcher(:beam)

# Get detailed status for a watcher
Beamlens.watcher_status(:beam)

# Check if alerts are pending investigation
Beamlens.pending_alerts?()

# Investigate pending alerts
{:ok, analysis} = Beamlens.investigate()
```

## Quality Verification

A judge agent reviews each analysis to verify conclusions are supported by collected data. If the judge finds issues, the agent automatically retries with feedback.

## Bring Your Own Model

BeamLens supports multiple LLM providers:

- Anthropic (default)
- OpenAI
- Google Gemini
- AWS Bedrock
- Azure OpenAI
- Ollama (run completely offline)
- OpenRouter, Together AI, and more

### Default: Anthropic

Set your API key and you're ready:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

### Custom Provider

Configure a custom provider globally via `client_registry`:

```elixir
{Beamlens,
  watchers: [{:beam, "*/5 * * * *"}],
  client_registry: %{
    primary: "Ollama",
    clients: [
      %{
        name: "Ollama",
        provider: "openai-generic",
        options: %{base_url: "http://localhost:11434/v1", model: "qwen3:4b"}
      }
    ]
  }}
```

This applies to all LLM calls: watcher baseline analysis, anomaly investigation, and the judge agent.

See the [BAML documentation](https://docs.boundaryml.com/) for all supported providers and options.

## What It Observes

BeamLens gathers safe, read-only runtime metrics:

- Scheduler utilization and run queues
- Memory breakdown (processes, binaries, ETS, code)
- Process and port counts with limits
- Atom table metrics
- Persistent term usage
- OTP release and uptime

## Circuit Breaker

Opt-in protection against LLM provider failures:

```elixir
{Beamlens,
  watchers: [{:beam, "*/5 * * * *"}],
  circuit_breaker: [enabled: true, failure_threshold: 5, reset_timeout: 30_000]}
```
