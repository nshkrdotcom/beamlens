# Architecture

BeamLens uses an **orchestrator-workers** architecture where specialized watchers autonomously monitor BEAM VM metrics, learn baseline behavior using LLMs, and detect anomalies. When issues are found, an AI agent investigates and correlates findings.

## Supervision Tree

Add BeamLens to your application's supervision tree:

```elixir
{Beamlens, watchers: [{:beam, "*/5 * * * *"}]}
```

This starts the following components:

```mermaid
graph TD
    S[Beamlens.Supervisor]
    S --> TS[TaskSupervisor]
    S --> CB[CircuitBreaker?]
    S --> WR[WatcherRegistry]
    S --> AQ[AlertQueue]
    S --> WS[Watchers.Supervisor]
    S --> AH[AlertHandler]

    WS --> W1[Watcher.Server: beam]
    WS --> W2[Watcher.Server: custom]

    TS -.-> AG[Agent]
    AH -.-> AG
```

Each watcher runs independently. If one crashes, others continue operating. CircuitBreaker is optional.

## Data Flow

Data flows through three stages: monitoring, orchestration, and investigation.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Monitoring
        VM[BEAM VM] --> S[Watcher.Server]
        S --> OH[ObservationHistory]
        OH --> BL[Baseline LLM]
    end

    subgraph Orchestration
        BL --> |anomaly| CD{Cooldown?}
        CD --> |no| Q[AlertQueue]
        CD --> |yes| X[Suppressed]
        Q --> H[AlertHandler]
    end

    subgraph Investigation
        H --> A[Agent]
        A --> |tool calls| LLM[LLM]
        LLM --> A
        A --> |review| J[Judge LLM]
        J --> R[HealthAnalysis]
    end
```

1. **Monitoring**: Watcher servers collect VM metrics on cron schedules, storing observations in a sliding window. The baseline LLM learns normal patterns and detects deviations.
2. **Orchestration**: When anomalies are detected, they pass through a cooldown check to prevent duplicate alerts, then flow through a queue to the handler.
3. **Investigation**: The agent runs a tool-calling loop to gather detailed metrics, then a judge reviews the analysis.

## Alert Cooldown

To prevent alert fatigue, detected anomalies are subject to a per-category cooldown. The baseline LLM specifies the cooldown duration based on context (defaulting to 5 minutes). After reporting an anomaly, subsequent anomalies of the same category within the cooldown period are suppressed. Categories are derived from the anomaly type prefix (e.g., "memory_high" → memory).

## Agent Loop

The agent uses an LLM to select which metrics to gather, executing tools until it has enough information to produce an analysis.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    START[Start] --> TOOL[LLM selects tool]
    TOOL --> EXEC[Execute tool]
    EXEC --> CHECK{Done?}
    CHECK --> |No| TOOL
    CHECK --> |Yes| JUDGE[Judge reviews]
    JUDGE --> |Accept| OUTPUT[HealthAnalysis]
    JUDGE --> |Retry| TOOL
```

Available tools include GetOverview, GetSystemInfo, GetMemoryStats, GetProcessStats, GetSchedulerStats, GetAtomStats, GetPersistentTerms, and GetTopProcesses.

## Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Watcher.Server | GenServer running individual watcher on cron schedule |
| ObservationHistory | Sliding window buffer for baseline observations |
| Baseline.Analyzer | Calls AnalyzeBaseline LLM to learn patterns and detect anomalies |
| Baseline.Context | Tracks LLM notes and timing for baseline learning |
| Baseline.Investigator | Tool-calling loop for watcher anomaly investigation |
| Baseline.Decision | Decision structs (ContinueObserving, Alert, Healthy) for baseline LLM output |
| AlertQueue | Buffer anomaly alerts from watchers |
| AlertHandler | Trigger investigation when alerts arrive |
| Agent | Run tool-calling loop to gather metrics |
| Judge | Review analysis quality, request retries if needed |
| CircuitBreaker | Protect against LLM rate limits (optional) |
| WatcherRegistry | Registry for looking up watcher processes by name |

## Included Watchers

### BEAM Watcher (`:beam`)

Monitors BEAM VM runtime health using LLM-driven baseline learning.

**Baseline Metrics** (tracked for pattern learning):
- Memory utilization %
- Process utilization %
- Port utilization %
- Atom utilization %
- Scheduler run queue depth
- Schedulers online

**Investigation Tools** (available when anomaly detected):

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_overview` | Utilization percentages across all categories |
| `get_system_info` | Node identity, OTP version, uptime, schedulers |
| `get_memory_stats` | Memory breakdown: total, processes, system, binary, ETS, code |
| `get_process_stats` | Process/port counts and limits |
| `get_scheduler_stats` | Scheduler counts and run queue |
| `get_atom_stats` | Atom table count, limit, memory |
| `get_persistent_terms` | Persistent term count and memory |
| `get_top_processes` | Top processes by memory, message queue, or reductions |

**Configuration:**
```elixir
{:beam, "*/5 * * * *"}  # Run every 5 minutes
```

## LLM Integration

BeamLens uses [BAML](https://docs.boundaryml.com) for type-safe LLM prompts via the [Puck](https://github.com/bradleygolden/puck) framework. Four BAML functions handle different stages:

- **AnalyzeBaseline**: Observes metrics over time, decides whether to continue watching, alert on anomaly, or report healthy
- **SelectInvestigationTool**: Watcher investigation loop, gathers detailed data after anomaly detection
- **SelectTool**: Main agent loop, chooses which metric-gathering tool to execute next
- **JudgeAnalysis**: Reviews the agent's analysis for quality, may request retries

## LLM Client Configuration

By default, BeamLens uses Anthropic's Claude Haiku. Configure alternative LLM providers via `:client_registry`:

```elixir
{Beamlens,
  watchers: [{:beam, "*/5 * * * *"}],
  client_registry: %{
    primary: "Ollama",
    clients: [
      %{name: "Ollama", provider: "openai-generic",
        options: %{base_url: "http://localhost:11434/v1", model: "llama3"}}
    ]
  }
}
```

The `client_registry` propagates through the supervision tree to all LLM-calling components:
- `Beamlens.Agent` for health analysis
- `Beamlens.Judge` for quality checks
- `Beamlens.AlertHandler` for alert investigation
- `Beamlens.Watchers.Baseline.Analyzer` for anomaly detection
- `Beamlens.Watchers.Baseline.Investigator` for deep investigation
